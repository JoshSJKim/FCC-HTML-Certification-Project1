        <p id="description">Hi! My name is Joon.K. I live in Toronto, Canada with my lovely, supportive wife and three children - Nathan, JJ, and Jubilee.</br>
        I never thought I would enjoy drawing, but it all started when my middle child, JJ, insisted that I draw dinosaurs every night for him to colour in the morning. This all happened at the beginning of the pandemic, and I had nothing else better to do at the time.</br>
        As I was carrying out my child's orders every night, I realized "I like to draw!"</br>
        It's been roughly two years since I began to draw. Please feel free to click on the instagram link above to see my drawings.</br>
        Also, I'd like to get to know fellow artists around the world. Please respond to some of the questions below and Let's Connect!</p>
